\title{Download a file, using http, https, or ftp}
\usage{
download(url, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The URL to download.}

\item{...}{Other arguments that are passed to \code{\link{download.file}}.}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper for \code{\link{download.file}} and takes all the same 
arguments. The only difference is that, if the protocol is https, it changes 
some settings to make it work. How exactly the settings are changed differs 
among platforms.
}
\details{
This function also should follow http redirects on all platforms, which is 
something that does not happen by default when \code{curl} is used, as on Mac
OS X.

With Windows, it either uses the \code{"wininet"} method (for R 3.2) or uses 
the \code{"internal"} method after first ensuring that \code{setInternet2}, 
is active (which tells R to use the \code{internet2.dll}).

On other platforms, it will try to use \code{libcurl}, \code{wget}, then 
\code{curl}, and then \code{lynx} to download the file. R 3.2 will typically 
have the \code{libcurl} method and for previous versions of R Linux platforms
will have \code{wget} installed, and Mac OS X will have \code{curl}.

Note that for many (perhaps most) types of files, you will want to use 
\code{mode="wb"} so that the file is downloaded in binary mode.
