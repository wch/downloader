Title: A package for downloading files over http and https
Description: This package provides a wrapper for the download.file function,
    making it possible to download files over https on Windows, Mac OS X, and
    other Unix-like platforms. The RCurl package provides this functionality
    (and much more) but can be difficult to install because it must be compiled
    with external dependencies. This package has no external dependencies, so
    it is much easier to install.
